The	O

is	O

for	O

and	O
our	O

During	O
2018	O
,	O
we	O
undertook	O
a	O
review	O
of	O
executive	O
remuneration	O
,	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
the	O
framework	O
remains	O
fit-for-purpose	O
as	O
OZ	O
Minerals	O
continues	O
to	O
grow.	O

The	O
result	O
of	O
that	O
review	O
suggested	O
that	O
OZ	O
Minerals	O
had	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
create	O
a	O
greater	O
alignment	O
of	O
executive	O
pay	O

with	O
the	O
shareholder	O
experience	O
and	O
simplify	O
a	O
framework	O
that	O
executives	O
perceived	O
to	O
be	O
complicated	O
and	O
in	O
many	O
cases	O
something	O
they	O
had	O
limited	O
ability	O
to	O
influence.	O

As	O
a	O
result	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
proposed	O
some	O
refinements	O
to	O
the	O
framework	O
in	O
2019	O
that	O
better	O
address	O
our	O
objectives	O
of	O
greater	O
alignment	O
between	O
shareholder	O
and	O
executive.	O

These	O
changes	O
will	O
,	O
if	O
performance	O
targets	O
are	O
met	O
,	O
put	O
equity	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O

earlier	O
and	O
require	O
them	O
to	O
hold	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
long	O

,	O
increasing	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O

of	O

and	O
encouraging	O

This	O
framework	O
also	O
provides	O
a	O

which	O

that	O
the	O

in	O

,	O
is	O
very	O

to	O

its	O
part	O
as	O
a	O
stable	O
value	O
asset	O
in	O
uncertain	O
times.	O

The	O
advent	O

also	O
support	O
gold	O
for	O
many	O

the	O

In	O
this	O

even	O

As	O

we	O
have	O
delivered	O
on	O
our	O

compared	O
to	O
FY18	O
when	O
we	O
completed	O
131	O

In	O

we	O
